  <h1>Welcome to The Friday Pint Club üçª</h1>
  <p>
    Every week, a small and dedicated group of enthusiasts embarks on a sacred ritual ‚Äî a Friday pint. 
    Born out of camaraderie and an unwavering commitment to ending the week on a high note, 
    <strong>The Friday Pint Club</strong> exists for one reason: to drink, to laugh, and to repeat.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're not a formal society. There are no memberships, no agendas, and definitely no spreadsheets. 
    Just a mutual understanding that the weekend starts with a cold pint in hand and good company all around.
