### Ali's Birthday

Speaking of pints, it's my birthday on Saturday and I was thinking of some midday pints in the sun warm rain (just checked the forecast) - A.Coates

Ali's birthday pints set for 1200, 24 May 25.

### Weekly Pint Meetups

At The Friday Pint Club, we keep things simple — because simplicity is beautiful, and also because calendars are hard.

Our one and only standing event is:

#### 🍺 **Friday Pint**

- **When?** Every Friday, like clockwork  
- **Where?** Somewhere on the spine (location may vary weekly)
- **Time?** 16:30 until the pints run dry or the conversation does

Each Friday we descend upon a chosen pub to mark the end of the week with a well-earned pint. The location might change, the weather might betray us, but one thing is certain — there will be beer and there will be friends.

Whether it's your first time or your fiftieth, you’re always welcome to pull up a chair and get involved.

### What to Expect

- Familiar faces and the occasional new recruit  
- Nonsensical chat and perhaps a philosophical revelation or two  
- Pub snacks of varying quality  
- A deeply unserious take on what constitutes a “club”  

If you’re unsure where we’re headed on a particular Friday, just reach out or check with one of the regulars — there’s always a plan (even if it’s made five minutes before arrival).

### Future Shenanigans?

From time to time, we may entertain the idea of additional club activities — brewery visits, pub quizzes, or perhaps a totally unnecessary pub crawl. If that ever happens, we’ll definitely put it here (but don’t hold your breath).

See you Friday? 🍻
