### Pint-Sized Memories 📸

Welcome to the visual vault of The Friday Pint Club — where the pints are cold, the expressions are candid, and the camera work is... enthusiastic, at best.

Here you'll find a collection of snapshots from our weekly meetings, commemorating the chaos, camaraderie, and occasional chips.

### Highlights from Recent Fridays

_Just a few scenes from our ongoing adventure into the art of pub-going:_

### Add Your Own?

Got a picture from a Friday night that needs to be immortalized? Send it over to the club archivist (unofficial role) and we’ll slap it up here for the world to admire.

We’re always looking to grow this page with new faces, new pubs, and new regrettable selfies. 📷

### Coming Soon

We’re working on a proper photo gallery layout with filters, captions, and maybe even a slideshow — but until then, enjoy the raw, unfiltered charm of our current collection.

See you next Friday — and don’t forget to smile for the camera. 🍻
