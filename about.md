### Welcome to The Friday Pint Club

We're a group of friends who share a simple yet enjoyable passion - going for a pint every Friday. What started as an informal gathering has grown into a close-knit community of like-minded individuals who value good company, great beer, and a relaxed atmosphere.

### Our Story

The Friday Pint Club was born out of a desire to create a regular social event that brings people together outside of work or other commitments. Our founders were fed up with the usual weekend routines and decided to take matters into their own hands. They gathered a small group of friends, picked a pub, and the rest is history.

### Our Values

At The Friday Pint Club, we believe in:

- **Community**: We're a club that's all about camaraderie and connection. Our members are like family - always ready to lend a listening ear or offer words of encouragement.

- **Friendship**: We're not just a drinking club; we're a group of friends who share laughs, stories, and memories over a pint (or two).

- **Inclusivity**: Everyone is welcome at The Friday Pint Club. Whether you're new to the area or just looking for a friendly crowd, you'll feel right at home.

- **Fun**: We take ourselves lightly, but not too seriously. Our events are always relaxed and enjoyable, with plenty of opportunities to let your hair down.

### Our Meetings

We meet every Friday on the spine. You can find us at 1630 enjoying good company, great beer, and occasionally some delicious pub grub. Whether you're a regular or just dropping by for a one-off visit, you'll always be welcome.

### Join Us
